# Check Point Network Security Integration Terraform module for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

> **Important Notes:**
> - This is a preview release of the CloudGuard Network Security Integration Terraform module for GCP.
>  - The GCP Network Security Integration is currently in private preview.
If you are interested in participating, please reach out to your local Check Point representative. They will contact the Check Point's Cloud Specialist (CSS) or Cloud Architect (CSA) that will gladly enroll you on the Early Availability (EA) program and offer additional documentation and assistance.

## Cross-Zone Deployment
### Intercept Deployment per Availability Zone in the Service VPC
To ensure that traffic is properly intercepted and inspected by Check Point firewalls, an intercept deployment and a corresponding forwarding rule to the Internal Load Balancer must be deployed for each Availability Zone utilized within the Security VPC. 
Note - If an Intercept Deployment is missing in a specific zone, traffic in that zone will bypass GCP Layer 7 policies and not be inspected, resulting in a potential security gap.
These deployments must be aligned with the zones where your workloads reside.
 
Our Terraform template supports a cross-zone deployment model.
Please define the relevant zones using the intercept_deployment_zones parameter in the main.tf file.

Example:
intercept_deployment_zones = ["us-central1-a", "us-central1-b"]

This configuration deploys intercept instances in both us-central1-a and us-central1-b.


## Before you begin
1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and set up billing on that project.
2. [Install Terraform] version **1.9.0** (minimum required) or higher, (https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) and read the Terraform Getting Started Guide that follows. This guide will assume basic proficiency with Terraform - it is an introduction to the Google provider.


3. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) (or use the existing one). Next, download the JSON key file. Name it something you can remember and store it somewhere secure on your machine. <br/>
4. Ensure that the Service Account possesses the following permissions, in addition to those listed in the main README:
 ```
    compute.firewallPolicies.create
    compute.firewallPolicies.delete
    compute.firewallPolicies.get
    compute.firewallPolicies.update
    compute.firewallPolicies.use
    compute.forwardingRules.create
    compute.forwardingRules.delete
    compute.forwardingRules.get
    compute.forwardingRules.use
    compute.globalOperations.get
    compute.healthChecks.create
    compute.healthChecks.delete
    compute.healthChecks.get
    compute.healthChecks.useReadOnly
    compute.instanceGroups.use
    compute.networks.create
    compute.networks.delete
    compute.networks.setFirewallPolicy
    compute.networks.use
    compute.regionBackendServices.create
    compute.regionBackendServices.delete
    compute.regionBackendServices.use
    compute.regionBackendServices.get
    compute.subnetworks.create
    compute.subnetworks.delete
    compute.zones.list
    networksecurity.interceptDeploymentGroups.create
    networksecurity.interceptDeploymentGroups.delete
    networksecurity.interceptDeploymentGroups.get
    networksecurity.interceptDeploymentGroups.use
    networksecurity.interceptDeployments.create
    networksecurity.interceptDeployments.delete
    networksecurity.interceptDeployments.get
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroupAssociations.create
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroupAssociations.delete
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroupAssociations.get
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroups.create
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroups.delete
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroups.get
    networksecurity.interceptEndpointGroups.use
    networksecurity.securityProfiles.create
```
Add the following Organization level permissions to the service account:
   ```
   Custom roles -  
   networksecurity.securityProfiles.* 
   networksecurity.securityProfileGroups.* 
   networksecurity.operations.get 
   ```
5. Enable the **Network Security API** and **Compute Engine API** for your project. You can do this by either:

   - Running the following `gcloud` commands:
     ```
     gcloud services enable networksecurity.googleapis.com
     ```
     ```
     gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
     ```
   - Enabling it manually via the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).

  }
```

## Conditional creation
<br />1. For each network and subnet variable, you can choose whether to create a new network with a new subnet or to use an existing one.

- If you want to create a new network and subnet, input a subnet CIDR block for the desired new network. In this case, the network name and subnetwork name will not be used:

```
    mgmt_network_name    = "not-use"
    mgmt_subnetwork_name = "not-use"
    mgmt_network_cidr    = "10.0.1.0/24"
```

- Otherwise, if you want to use the existing network and subnet, leave empty double quotes in the CIDR variable for the desired network:

```
    mgmt_network_name    = "network name"
    mgmt_subnetwork_name = "subnetwork name"
    mgmt_network_cidr    = "10.0.1.0/24"
```

<br />2. To create a Firewall and allow traffic for ICMP, TCP, UDP, SCTP, and/or ESP - enter the list of Source IP ranges.
```
ICMP_traffic   = ["123.123.0.0/24", "234.234.0.0/24"]
TCP_traffic    = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
UDP_traffic    = []
SCTP_traffic   = []
ESP_traffic    = []
```
Leave an empty list for a protocol if you want to disable traffic for it.
